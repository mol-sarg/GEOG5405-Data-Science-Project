# GEOG5405-Data-Science-Project

This project was completed for the 'Analytics for Urban Policy' module. It included a data science notebook and a policy briefing. I chose to do my project on noise pollution in Leeds, looking at over 10 years of noise complaint data from Leeds City Council. In 2024, the council decided to stop the out-of-hours noise complaint live service as a result of budget cuts, moving to a digital system.

This project aimed to understand the impacts that removing this service would have, using temporal analysis to find patterns and forecast future complaints in Leeds.
